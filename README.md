# About I2P ( The Invisible Internet Project )

I2P (The Invisible Internet Project), is a fully encrypted private network layer that has been developed with privacy and security by design in order to provide protection for your activity, location and your identity. 
The desktop software ships with a router that connects you to the network and includes applications for sharing, communicating and building.

The network has the same capabilities as the Internet: you can create and vistit I2P sites, email, create forums and share content. If you are an application developer, you can create your own I2P applications. 
The protocol and software is Free-Open Source and community built. It has been in active development since 2001.
